This program aims to calculate the topological graph based on this paper:

<b>The way of operation:</b> 

Choose the related .shp file into the input field, then click <i> the specifi button </i>. The result will be automatically saved as "cross.txt" and "within.txt" in the same directory with your data files. 

Having ArcGIS SDK .NET installed is a prerequisite to run the program. This program is compatible with ArcGIS 10.0 and 10.2.

Note that, if more than 10000 nodes, it might take a while for generating the result. Normally it takes 40 minutes for 120000 nodes.
